			<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
			posted by BGB, November 15, 2016
			<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking
			technique called <i> sous vide</i>. In <i> sous vide</i>
			cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a
			water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the
			food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff
			Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
			<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill
			Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before
			<time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.</p>
			<p>Location:<br>
			Bakerâ€™s Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>
			<p>Hours: Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to 11pm</p>
